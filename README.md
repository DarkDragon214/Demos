<h2>Discord Bot</h2>

<p>I created a discord bot for personal use as a fun project a while back. The project is abandoned, and as such some of the features are deprecated since I was in the process of rewriting the bot as a whole.</p>
<p>This project made use of several APIs to retrieve images and videos that the user can request through commands. I have included example usage of the image and video commands that were used in the past as well as a current example of the image command that I was rewriting. The included code has dummy tokens so it doesn't function.</p>
<p>The <strong>video.py</strong> code was part of the old code that I included as an example of how it worked.</p>


<h2>Multithreaded Hashing</h2>

<p>A project where threads were used to hash files of varying size. Included is a report on the outcome of the project as well as the instructions given. Unfortunately the files for hashing could not be included as they were above GitHub's size limit.</p>


<h2>Simple Shell</h2>

<p>This project was written in C and designed to mimic the linux shell. Included are requirements/instructions for the code <br>(p1-3377.pdf) as well as test cases (p1tc).</p>


<h2>Steganography</h2>

<p>A group project meant to emulate research and development of a product. This project is currently ongoing, entering the final stages of development. My contribution to this project was developing the hide.py and extract.py codes as well as assisting/advising development for the user interface.</p>

<p>Included is a poster in the form of a powerpoint highlighting several aspects of the project.</p>

<p>To run this code, make sure the requirements (listed in requirements.txt) are installed and run app.py. There should be a link leading to a localhost where the application can be interacted with.</p>
